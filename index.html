        <h1>How to Build a PC</h1>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Building a PC is a complex but rewarding process that involves assembling various hardware components 
            to create a fully functional personal computer. The first step in building a PC is to gather all the 
            necessary components, which typically include a CPU (central processing unit), motherboard, 
            RAM (random access memory), storage devices such as hard drives or solid-state drives, graphics card, power supply unit (PSU), 
            and a computer case. It's essential to ensure that all the components are compatible with each other and match the intended purpose of the PC,
            whether it's for gaming, video editing, or general computing.

    <h3>Components</h3>
    <p>
        Before we start putting anything in our case or assembling 
        the components that connect to the motherboard, lets make
        sure we have everything. Here's what we'll need:</p>
        <br>
        <code id="components-in-code">
          <ul class="components">
            <br> 
            <li>Motherboard</li>
            <li>Case</li>
           <li>RAM (This stands for Random Access Memory)</li>
           <li>CPU (This stands for Central Processing Unit)</li>
           <li>A CPU cooler (either liquid or air)</li>
           <li>PSU (This stands for Power Supply Unit)</li>
           <li>Hard Drive or Solid State Drive</li>
           <li>A copy of your preferred operating system</li>
           <br>
            </ul>
        </code>

        <p>While some computer builds have more components than these, like a GPU or other PCIE slot items;
            these will be the basic items every build will need to get up and running.

    <h3>Assembly</h3>
    <p>
        Once you make sure you have all the listed components, you can
        begin assembling your computer.
